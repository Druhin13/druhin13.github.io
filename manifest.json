	"description": "UX Designer specializing in Visual Design making interfaces more human, effective, and easy to use. Iâ€™m Druhin, a 19y/o designer currently freelancing. In the past, I have worked as a UI/UX designer with some digital agencies and a few mid-sized startups. In addition to that, I've also been a member of the Awwwards Young Jury for the past 8 months. Besides being a designer with around 3 years of experience, I also have the ability to bring my design ideas to life with a bit of my front-end coding skills.",
